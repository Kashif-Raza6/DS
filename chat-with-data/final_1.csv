fruitiness to the palate. Lemons and Coriander add layers of fresh citrus

variety of floral tones. Finally, Bay, Thyme and Rosemary add a finely balanced

elderberries, mint, almonds, jasmine, ginger, Vervain and chamomile, to name a

itself well to use in cocktails such as Martinis and Gimlets, as well as being
mixed with tonic and garnished with a slice of orange., Appearance: Clear with a silvery, glycerous appearance.<o:p></o:p>, Aroma: Crisp and fresh on the nose. The initial perfumed

somewhat unconventional, some tasters found the aromatics a little cologne
like.<o:p></o:p>, Taste: On the palate, this begins soft and glycerous,
gradually building intensity, climaxing in an explosion of peppers; mid palate
is off dry and oily with juniper, lavender, pine needle and spice. Some tangy
notes in the mouth add extra freshness to the traditional characters. Fairly

Pipers 12-Year-Old is a blend of malt and grain whiskies, with a significant
proportion of their fingerprint whisky sourced from Allt A Bhainne distillery

different proportions resulting in the smooth, and flavorful whisky. It
contains only the finest and carefully selected batches of malt and grain
whiskies which are finished in impeccable Oak barrels. The youngest whisky used
in this expression carries an age-statement of 12 years which reflects the
smooth palate of the 100 Pipers 12-Year-Old. The presence of a predominant

was first introduced back in 2006 when the company released its first 4-year-old

Alphonse Kerkhof in Templeton, Iowa. Templeton Rye 6-Year Rye Whiskey was
distilled from a recipe of 95% rye and 5% barley at MGP in Lawrenceburg,
Indiana. Following its first release, the company quickly experienced its fair
share of controversy after the company was the subject of a class-action
lawsuit over alleged deceptive marketing practices. The 6-year expression,
which was first released in 2016, is also distilled from the same recipe by MGP
and the juice is sent to Templeton, Iowa, where the company adds their own
proprietary formula and local purified water before bottling the whiskey at
their facility., Color:
Light Copper., Nose:
The nose is relatively simple, delivering the obvious rye spice that is
expected from a 95% MGP rye, some dry herbal notes, along with notes of sweet
caramel, vanilla, some toasted coconut, and a touch of smoky oak., Palate:
This rye has a relatively light mouthfeel and there is minimal rye spice and
heat on the palate. Instead, the palate is dominated mostly by sweet notes,
including vanilla, caramel, some crisp green apple, baking spice, and smoky
oak., Finish:
The finish is undoubtedly the best part of this rye. It is medium-long with a
nice combination of alcohol burn and rye spice. The heavier spicy notes are
balanced by the sweetness of caramel, maraschino cherry, dry oak, and a few
dill-like herbal notes that finish out the pour.",200

modern winemaking dates from the 17th century and was handed down by able monks
from the Carthusian monastery in Bordeaux, who had acquired considerable talent
as viticulturists and winemakers. The people who produce the wine in the 21st

subjected to a gradual transformation through contact with air and wood. This
results in considerable evaporation and concentration, with approximately 35%
of the original volume of a 20-year-old tawny disappearing before it is
eventually bottled. Constant attention is needed as maturing barrels and vats
of varied sizes will show marked differences as they age. The master blender,
cellar master and coopers all play their parts in nurturing the maturing wines
until finally a beautifully balanced aged tawny Port emerges. Dow’s Aged
Tawnies have a singular identity which strives to balance the proportion of
wood character with the original fine fruit flavours. To achieve this style,
the Dow’s tasters have traditionally aged a proportion of their ageing tawnies
in the larger well-seasoned oak balseiros, with capacities ranging from 5,000
to 10,000 <span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">liters<span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">. The result is that the Dow’s Aged Tawnies retain an
attractive fruit character and lose less intensity over the years, with a
deeper colour than most. This, combined with the hallmark drier style of Dow’s,
creates unique Ports with a distinctive style, Dow’s 20-Year-Old is the perfect example of an aged tawny
Port, an elegant balance of mellow fruit combines with the complex
characteristics from prolonged wood-ageing., With a polished brown centre and orangeamber edges, this
wine has a honeysuckle scent with discreet butterscotch notes. Refined and
balanced on the palate, flinty and mellowed tannins meld with concentrated red
